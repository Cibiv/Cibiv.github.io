### Research interests
<div class="hline"></div>

* Bioinformatics
* Phylogenetics
* Evolution
* Phylogenomics
* Biodiversity and Conservation
* Algorithms
* High Performance Computing
* Software Engineering


### Software
<div class="hline"></div>

Software development is my hobby with C++ as favorite language. The following scientific software is all GNU-GPL licensed. IQ-TREE is my main interest right now, which has reached about 90,000 lines of codes.

* [IQ-TREE: Efficient phylogenetic software by maximum likelihood](http://www.iqtree.org)
* [PDA - Phylogenetic Diversity Analyzer](http://www.cibiv.at/software/pda)
* [IQPNNI (superseded by IQ-TREE) - Important Quartet Puzzling and Nearest Neighbor Interchange](http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqpnni)

Occasionally I also programmed in Java for fun. A five-in-a-row game engine, which reached a very competitive level vs. Human, is available for Android:

* [BCaro Lite: Five-in-a-row app (Gomoku) for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.caro&hl=en)
