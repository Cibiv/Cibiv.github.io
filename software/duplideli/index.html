<h2>DupliDeli - Estimation of Gene Family Specific Duplication and Deletion Rates</h2>

<h4>Introduction:</h4>

<b>DupliDeli</b> is a computer program for the estimation of gene family specific duplication and 
deletion rates as well as the ancestral number of gene copies. It uses a stochastic birth and death 
process to model the change in gene family size along a phylogenetic tree. For the specific numbers of 
gene family members of extant species, and given the corresponding species tree for these species, 
DupliDeli can estimate the birth and death rate specific for the gene family. 

DupliDeli is written in the object-oriented programming language Java.
