# short title of the software
title: An analysis pipeline for insertion pool sequencing data

# short description of the software
description: The iPool-Seq analysis pipeline is based on the TRUmiCount algorithm (Pflug et al. 2018) for the quantitative analysis of UMI data, and takes are of all steps of the analysis of iPool-Seq data. From from raw sequencing reads it computes the differential virulences of the mutants in the pre-infection pool compared to a set of reference mutants.
# Type must be either:

# Miscellaneous
type: Next Generation Sequencing
