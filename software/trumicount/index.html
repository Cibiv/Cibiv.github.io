# short title of the software
title: TRUmiCount - Correctly counting molecules using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs)

# short description of the software
description: For NGS experiments using UMIs, molecules that are lost entirely during the sequencing process cause under-estimation of the molecule count, and amplification artifacts like PCR chimeras cause over-estimation. TRUmiCount uses a mechanistic model of PCR amplification to correct UMI data for both types of errors. The phantom-filtered and loss-corrected molecule counts computed by TRUmiCount measure the true number of molecules with considerably higher accuracy than the raw number of distinct UMIs.
