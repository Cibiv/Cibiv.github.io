# short title of the software
title: TRUmiCount - Correctly counting molecules using UMIs

# short description of the software
description: For NGS experiments using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), molecules that are lost entirely during sequencing cause under-estimation of the molecule count, and amplification artifacts like PCR chimeras cause over-estimation. TRUmiCount corrects UMI data for both types of errors, thus improving the accuracy of measured molecule counts considerably.
# Type must be either:
