# short description of the software
description: A software package for optimizing NGS read mapping results. Through rapid automated benchmarks on simulated or real data sets, the most suitable mapper for an experiment can be found within minutes. By testing the same mapper on multiple parameter settings, results can be further tuned for accuracy or speed. At the end of each benchmark, Teaser presents the results in a browser-viewable report that includes interactive figures.
